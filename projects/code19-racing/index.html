            I worked on a drone platform used to demonstrate autonomy, vision, and RF sensing software developed by a defense-focused company.
            My role was focused on mechanical integration and testing. That included mounting cameras, onboard compute, radios, and RF hardware,
            dealing with wiring and shielding issues, and making sure parts could be removed and replaced without tearing the whole system apart.
            A lot of the work came down to fit, layout, and what happens when the drone lands harder than planned.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The platform combined cameras, onboard compute, radios, and RF detection into a single airframe.
        From a mechanical standpoint, the challenge was keeping everything accessible and protected while testing was ongoing.
        Once the full RF stack was powered, layout and shielding started to matter for GPS performance, so parts were moved
        and rerouted as issues showed up. The goal was a setup that could be flown, adjusted, and repaired without turning
        every change into a rebuild.

    <!-- ================= DESIGN APPROACH ================= -->

      <h2>Design Approach</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Integration decisions were driven by what was most likely to break first.
        Impacts, vibration, cable fatigue, and RF interference all showed up during testing.
        The priority was keeping expensive hardware protected and easy to access, even if that meant
        giving up some packaging efficiency. RF layout also became important once GPS dropouts started
        appearing with certain hardware combinations.

            <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> fit sensors and compute without blocking access or airflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Serviceability:</strong> parts that break or get handled often needed fast removal.</li>

            After a few crashes during early testing, it became clear that the landing gear should take the damage instead
            of the frame or electronics. I designed the landing gear mount with a defined weak point so it would crack in one
            predictable location. The geometry was adjusted in Fusion 360 using an impact-style load case and then tested
            through actual crashes. When it failed, it failed where intended, which kept repairs simple.
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Issue:</strong> rigid landing gear transfers impact loads into the frame.</li>
            <li><strong>Change:</strong> introduce a controlled weak section in the mount.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> repeated failures at the same spot, protecting the rest of the drone.</li>

            3D printing was the main way changes were made quickly.
            I designed and printed battery cases, sensor mounts, adapters, and protective housings so components
            could be moved or replaced without reworking the entire layout. These parts were designed around fit,
            access, and replacement rather than appearance, and were iterated directly from test feedback.

            I built a Python and OpenCV pipeline to support detection when drones appeared very small against the sky.
            The approach focused on finding the horizon to reduce the search area, then flagging motion-based candidates.
            This ran alongside a YOLO-based detector: when YOLO could classify a target, it took priority, and when it could not,
            the OpenCV pipeline still provided usable information for the operator and downstream systems.
